1) Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

2) Given an array of elements, return the length of the longest subarray where all its elements are distinct.
For example, given the array [5, 1, 3, 5, 2, 3, 4, 1], return 5 as the longest subarray of distinct elements is [5, 2, 3, 4, 1].

3) Given n numbers, find the greatest common denominator between them.
For example, given the numbers [42, 56, 14], return 14.
